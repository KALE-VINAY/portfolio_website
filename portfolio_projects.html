    <i><h2><b>Quantum Wavelet Transformation</b></h2></i>        
    <i><p>The integration of NEQR, an enhanced quantum image reprThis project delves into the challenges of noise in raw images and addresses this hindrance through the innovative application of QWT. By extending classical wavelet transforms, QWT efficiently extracts relevant frequency information from images, demonstrating substantial benefits for image denoising. esentation model, further optimizes storage and computational efficiency. Through this novel combination, we aim to enhance the quality and reliability of image-based information, with potential applications spanning medical science, telecommunications, meteorology, and beyond. The successful application of Quantum Wavelet Transform in image denoising opens up promising avenues for the intersection of quantum computing with image processing, contributing to the ongoing evolution of quantum technologies in diverse domains.

    <i><h2><b>Wireless Respiratory Monitoring System with Capacitive Sensing</b></h2> </i>       
    <i><p>We have created a compact device that monitors patients' breathing, transmitting readings to a mobile app via Bluetooth. The device utilizes parallel plate capacitor sensors for accurate breathing measurements, while a 33mm x 29mm Arduino Bluno Beetle microcontroller processes capacitance changes and seamlessly projects the data into the mobile app.

    <i><h2><b>Stock Recommendation using Machine learning model</b></h2> </i>       
    <i><p>This project developed a stock recommendation system using a machine learning model
        trained on real-time financial data web-scraped from the Screener website. The goal was to build
        a predictive model that could recommend whether to invest in a particular stock based on its
        historical financial performance.
        The project found that the GradientBoostingClassifier model performed the best, with an
        accuracy of 77%. This means that the model correctly classified 77% of the stocks in the test
        set.
        The project concluded that the GradientBoostingClassifier model is a promising tool for stock
        recommendation. However, the model was only trained on data from the Indian stock market.

    <i><h2><b>Quantum Data Communication</b></h2></i>        
    <i><p>Quantum data communication using qubits to send the classical data and E91 protocol-based quantum secure communication (QKD). Here, we have developed hybrid architecture using E91 Direct Variable Quantum Key Distribution protocol-based Quantum communication for transmission of data with HDLC fames in the existing internet. The hybrid architecture was implemented and simulated in IBM Quantum lab using Qiskit supported by Python. The simulation results ensure successful transmission of HDLC data frames using Qubits and successful recovery data after quantum measurements. Our findings shows the resistance to security issues such as identity disclosure, traceability, message authentication and eavesdropping attacks. The implementation of hybrid approach opens an avenue for quantum internet working with HDLC framing.
